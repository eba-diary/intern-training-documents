# The Emma B. Andrews Diary Project & Newbook Digital Texts: Intern Training Material

Newbook Digital Texts is an innovative digital humanities publishing house re-imagining and restructuring traditional academic research, publication, and education.  Over six years, more than 140 University of Washington undergraduate interns and several graduate assistants have collaborated with faculty on projects ranging from Ottoman and Georgian poetry to nineteenth-century travel journals from Iraq and Egypt.  

*  We promote systemic change in undergraduate education, technological innovation, and the preservation of at-risk historical documents.
*  Our work is international, open source, and open access.  
*  We are devoted to blending the traditional values of the humanities with the development of technological competency, effective communication skills, and the ability to work in a team-based environment.

Welcome to the Emma B. Andrews Diary Project! Our team is working to transcribe and encode Nile travel journals, letters and other historical documents from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Emma Andrews was an intrepid female diarist who visited Egypt over the course of two decades between 1889 and 1914. She was present when many archaeological discoveries were made in the Valley of the Kings, and her journals are an important source for history and society at the time. 

Our project is a founding member of Newbook DIgital Texts. We train undergraduate student interns in Digital Humanities.  We’ve been developing a training manual to get new interns up to speed in project work which includes transcription and encoding. For many interns, this is their first time doing these tasks so the learning curve is steep. We need help testing the documentation so that we can make sure it’s clear, complete and user-friendly.

We’ll ask #mozsprint contributors to comment on the clarity of instructions, user-friendliness of the manual and tell us if they find it easy to mark up our texts using the tag set we define.

This is a unique opportunity to work ‘hands on’ with primary source historical material, and help us develop a training manual to support the work of our awesome group of undergraduate student interns!
